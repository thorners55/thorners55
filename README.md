# Stephanie Thornley

Hello! I'm Stephanie, a Junior Software Developer from Leeds.

I've gone from History grad to coding bootcamp grad, which seems like a big change, but they're not so different. As a logical thinker who appreciates the smaller details as well as the bigger picture, the transition came naturally to me. I love the process of coding (even debugging!), and I also enjoy learning about the history of tech and how its advancements are affected by society, and vice versa.
